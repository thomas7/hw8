This assignment is relevant to an Intro to Unix course because it helps to develop skills using the bash shell. The shell is an extremely important part of Unix, and learning how to use it is key for anyone being introduced to Unix.

Knowing how to write your own Bash script can save a user tons of time when doing something that may be tedious and repetitive. By writing your own Bash script you really gain a lot more understanding of how the shell works and operates, and this is great for anyone new to Unix.

This assignment also has a focus on regular expressions. I was inspired to use regular expressions from an assignment from ECE 3574, which this assignment is based off of. I didn't understand regular expressions at the time, and now knowing how they work I see how useful they can be, and I wish I had learned about them years ago. Using regular expressions on the command line and paired with other commands can save you tons of time, so I think they are also very important for newcomers to learn about.

I would distribute points around these guidlines, based on the assignment being worth 30 points:

+ style 5/30
+ error checking 6/30 (2 points for each of the three errors handled)
+ average is calculated correctly 10/30 (reads stdin correctly and stores into correct output file given on command line)
+ average is formatted correctly 4/30 (int or float)
+ format for average is found using regular expressions 5/30

If the program didn't run I would deduct 5 points and then I would read through the code and award points based on which elements of the code were written correctly.
